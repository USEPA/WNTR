The Water Network Tool for Resilience (WNTR) is a Python package designed to simulate and 
analyze resilience of water distribution networks. The software includes capability to:

* Generate water network models
* Modify network structure and operations
* Add disruptive events including pipe leaks
* Add response/repair strategies
* Simulate pressure dependent demand and demand-driven hydraulics
* Simulate water quality 
* Evaluate resilience 
* Visualize results
