The PyEPANET module provides a wrapper around the EPANET programmer's 
tookit. The EN_XXX constants are defined in pyepanet.toolkit, but are 
imported by default as members of pyepanet. The ENepanet class is defined
in pyepanet.epanet2 and instantiating an object of this class loads the 
library and then provides pythonic functions equivalent to the EPANET 
tookit ENmethodname functions.
