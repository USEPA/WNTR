    "WNTR includes capabilities to help build drinking water distribution network models from geospatial data files (e.g., GeoJSON and Shapefile). The following tutorial illustrates how to generate drinking water distribution network models from perfect and imperfect geospatial datasets. In this tutorial, a perfect dataset represents high quality geospatial data from a drinking water utility that can be used to generate a model without additional modification, while an imperfect dataset represents data from a drinking water utility that requires modifications before WNTR can be used to generate a network model.\n",

    "The following tutorial uses the KY 4 water distribution network model downloaded from the [UKnowledge Water Distribution Systems Research Database](https://uknowledge.uky.edu/wdsrd/). This model is used to create perfect geospatial data which accurately and wholly reflects junctions, tanks, reservoirs, pipes, and pumps in the original model. The imperfect geospatial data was generated by truncating, skewing, and omitting certain aspects of the perfect data.\n",
