    "# WNTR Saltwater Intrusion Tutorial\n",
    "The following tutorial illustrates the use of storm surge data associated with hurricanes to simulate saltwater intrusion into a drinking water distribution system.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis uses storm surge data from [EPA's Creating Resilient Water Utilities (CRWU) website](https://epa.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapSeries/index.html?appid=852ca645500d419e8c6761b923380663), which sources data from [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA's) Sea, Lake, and Overland Surge from Hurricanes (SLOSH) model](https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/nationalsurge/). The SLOSH model is used by the National Weather Service to estimate storm surge during hurricanes. To simplify the analysis in this tutorial, the saltwater inundation rate into the drinking water distribution system is assumed to be proportional to the storm surge depth. A more detailed analysis could be pursued by following the methodology laid out by Moglen et al. in their paper titled [\"A nexus approach to infrastructure resilience planning under uncertainty\"](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0951832022005464).\n",
    "\n",
    "The water network model used in the analysis is KY 4 from the [UKnowledge Water Distribution Systems Research Database](https://uknowledge.uky.edu/wdsrd/). For this tutorial, the model coordinates were changed, so that the network is in a coastal location near Tampa."
