Storm water resilience
======================================

The following section describes capabilities in WNTR to 
quantify the resilience of storm water and wastewater systems.  
The capabilities leverage SWMM, pyswmm and swmmio along with classes, modules, 
and functions that were developed for drinking water resilience analysis in WNTR.

This functionality resides in the :class:`~wntr.stormwater` module.
To import this module and use it under the WNTR namespace, run::

	import wntr.stormwater as swntr

.. note:: 
   The stormwater module is a beta release.  
   Additional development, testing, and use is needed before the 
   software is ready for widespread use.  Feedback is appreciated.
