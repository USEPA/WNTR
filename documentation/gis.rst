Geospatial capabilities
======================================

The junctions, tanks, reservoirs, pipes, pumps, and valves in a :class:`~wntr.network.model.WaterNetworkModel` 
can be converted to GeoPandas GeoDataFrames as described in :ref:`model_io`.
The GeoDataFrames can be used 
directly within WNTR, 
with geospatial Python packages such as GeoPandas and Shapely, and saved to GeoJSON and Shapefiles for use
in GIS platforms.
Open source GIS platforms include QGIS and GRASS GIS.
The following section describes capabilities in WTNR that use GeoPandas GeoDataFrames.  

.. note:: 
   Functions that use GeoDataFrames require the Python package **geopandas** [JVFM21]_ 
   and **rtree** [rtree]_. Both are optional dependencies of WNTR.
   Note that **shapely** is installed with geopandas.

The following examples use a water network generated from Net1.inp.
The :class:`~wntr.gis.geospatial.snap` and :class:`~wntr.gis.geospatial.intersect` examples 
also use additional GIS data stored in the 
`examples/data <https://github.com/USEPA/WNTR/blob/main/examples/data>`_ directory.

For simplicity, the examples in this section assume that all network and data coordinates are in 
the EPSG:4326 coordinate reference system (CRS).  
**Note that EPANET does not have a standard or default coordinate reference system.**
More information on setting and transforming CRS is included in :ref:`crs`.
    

.. doctest::

.. _gis_data:

Water network GIS data
------------------------

The :class:`~wntr.network.io.to_gis` function is used to 
create a collection of GeoDataFrames from a WaterNetworkModel.
The collection of GeoDataFrames is stored in a :class:`~wntr.gis.network.WaterNetworkGIS` object 
which contains a GeoDataFrame
for each of the following model components: 

* junctions
* tanks
* reservoirs
* pipes
* pumps
* valves

Note that patterns, curves, sources, controls, and options are not stored in the GeoDataFrame representation.

.. doctest::
    :skipif: gpd is None

    >>> wn_gis = wntr.network.to_gis(wn)

Individual GeoDataFrames are obtained as follows (Note that the example network, Net1, has no valves and thus the GeoDataFrame for valves is empty).

.. doctest::
    :skipif: gpd is None

    >>> wn_gis.junctions # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> wn_gis.tanks # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> wn_gis.reservoirs # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> wn_gis.pipes # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> wn_gis.pumps # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> wn_gis.valves # doctest: +SKIP
	
For example, the junctions GeoDataFrame contains the following information:

.. doctest::
    :skipif: gpd is None

    >>> print(wn_gis.junctions.head())
       node_type  elevation  initial_quality                   geometry
    10  Junction    216.408        5.000e-04  POINT (20.00000 70.00000)
    11  Junction    216.408        5.000e-04  POINT (30.00000 70.00000)
    12  Junction    213.360        5.000e-04  POINT (50.00000 70.00000)
    13  Junction    211.836        5.000e-04  POINT (70.00000 70.00000)
    21  Junction    213.360        5.000e-04  POINT (30.00000 40.00000)

Each GeoDataFrame contains attributes and geometry:

Attributes
^^^^^^^^^^

    A GeoDataFrame contains attributes that are generated 
    from the WaterNetworkModel dictionary representation.
    However, the GeoDataFrame only includes attributes that are stored as numerical values or strings 
    (such as junction node type and elevation).  
    Attributes that are stored as lists or other objects (such as demand timeseries) 
    are not included in the GeoDataFrame.  
    The index for each GeoDataFrame is the model component name.

    Additional attributes can be added to the GeoDataFrames using the 
    :class:`~wntr.gis.network.WaterNetworkGIS.add_node_attributes` and 
    :class:`~wntr.gis.network.WaterNetworkGIS.add_link_attributes` methods.
    Additional attributes, such as simulation results or a resilience metric, can be used in further analysis and visualization.

    The following example adds the simulated pressure at hour 1 to the water network GIS data 
    (which includes pressure at junctions, tanks, and reservoirs).
    
    .. doctest::
       :skipif: gpd is None

        >>> sim = wntr.sim.EpanetSimulator(wn)
        >>> results = sim.run_sim()
        >>> wn_gis.add_node_attributes(results.node['pressure'].loc[3600,:], 
    	...     'Pressure_1hr')
    
    Attributes can also be added directly to individual GeoDataFrames, as shown below.
    
    .. doctest::
       :skipif: gpd is None

        >>> wn_gis.junctions['new attribute'] = 10

Geometry
^^^^^^^^^^

    Each GeoDataFrame also contains a `geometry` column which contains 
    geometric objects commonly used in geospatial analysis.
    :numref:`table-geometry-type` includes water network model components and the 
    geometry type that defines each component.  
    Geometry types include 
    ``shapely.geometry.Point``, ``shapely.geometry.LineString``, and ``shapely.geometry.MultiLineString``.
    A few components can be defined using multiple types:

    * Pumps and valves can be stored as lines (default) or points. While pumps are defined as 
      lines within WNTR (and EPANET), converting the geometry to points can be useful for 
      geospatial analysis and visualization. The following example stores pumps and valves as points.
	  
      .. doctest::
        :skipif: gpd is None

        >>> wn_gis = wntr.network.to_gis(wn, pumps_as_points=True, 
    	...     valves_as_points=True)
		
    * Pipes that do not contain vertices, interior vertex points that allow the visual depiction of curved pipes, are stored as a LineString while pipes that contain 
      vertices are stored as a MultiLineString.

    .. _table-geometry-type:
    .. table:: Geometry Types for Water Network Model Components
   
       ==============================  ===============================
       Water Network Model Component   Shapely Geometry Type
       ==============================  ===============================
       Junction                        Point
       Tank                            Point
       Reservoir                       Point
       Pipe                            LineString or MultiLineString 
       Pump                            LineString or Point
       Valve                           LineString or Point
       ==============================  ===============================
   
A WaterNetworkGIS object can also be written to GeoJSON and Shapefiles using 
the object's :class:`~wntr.gis.network.WaterNetworkGIS.write_geojson` and 
:class:`~wntr.gis.network.WaterNetworkGIS.write_shapefile` methods. 
See :ref:`shapefile_format` for more information on Shapefile format.

The GeoJSON and Shapefiles can be loaded into GIS platforms for further analysis and visualization.
An example of creating GeoJSON files from a WaterNetworkModel using the function :class:`~wntr.gis.network.WaterNetworkGIS.write_geojson`
is shown below.

.. doctest::
    :skipif: gpd is None

    >>> wn_gis.write_geojson('Net1')
	
This creates the following GeoJSON files for junctions, tanks, reservoirs, pipes, and pumps 
(Note that the example network, Net1, has no valves and thus the Net1_valves.geojson file is not created):

* Net1_junctions.geojson
* Net1_tanks.geojson
* Net1_reservoirs.geojson
* Net1_pipes.geojson
* Net1_pumps.geojson

A WaterNetworkModel can also be created from a collection of GeoDataFrames using the function
:class:`~wntr.network.io.from_gis` as shown below.

.. doctest::
    :skipif: gpd is None

    >>> wn2 = wntr.network.from_gis(wn_gis)


Additional GIS data
------------------------

Additional GIS data can also be utilized within 
WNTR to add attributes to the water network model and analysis. Examples of these additional GIS datasets include:

* **Point geometries** that could contain utility billing data, hydrant locations, isolation valve locations, or the location of emergency services.
  These geometries can be associated with points and lines in a water network model by snapping the point to the nearest component.
* **LineString or MultiLineString geometries** that could contain street layout or earthquake fault lines.
  These geometries can be associated with points and lines in a water network model by finding the intersection.
* **Polygon geometries** that could contain elevation, building footprints, zoning, land cover, hazard maps, census data, demographics, or social vulnerability.
  These geometries can be associated with points and lines in a water network model by finding the intersection.

The snap and intersect examples below used additional GIS data stored in the 
`examples/data <https://github.com/USEPA/WNTR/blob/main/examples/data>`_ directory.

Note, the GeoPandas ``read_file`` and ``to_file`` functions can be used to read/write external GeoJSON and Shapefiles in Python.

.. _crs:

Coordinate reference system
--------------------------------------

The coordinate reference system (CRS) of geospatial data is important to understand.
CRSs can be geographic (e.g., latitude/longitude where the units are in degrees) or 
projected (e.g., Universal Transverse Mercator where units are in meters).
GeoPandas includes documentation on managing projections at https://geopandas.org/en/stable/docs/user_guide/projections.html.
Several important points on CRS are listed below.

* The GeoPandas ``set_crs`` and ``to_crs`` methods can be used to set and transform the CRS of GeoDataFrames.
* The WNTR WaterNetworkGIS object also includes 
  :class:`~wntr.gis.network.WaterNetworkGIS.set_crs` and 
  :class:`~wntr.gis.network.WaterNetworkGIS.to_crs` methods to set and 
  transform the CRS of the junctions, tanks, reservoirs, pipes, pumps, and valves GeoDataFrames.
* WNTR includes additional methods to modify coordinates on the WaterNetworkModel object, see :ref:`modify_node_coords` for more information.
* When converting a WaterNetworkModel into GeoDataFrames using :class:`~wntr.network.io.to_gis` and 
  when creating GeoJSON and Shapefiles from a WaterNetworkModel using 
  :class:`~wntr.network.io.write_geojson` and :class:`~wntr.network.io.write_shapefile`, 
  the user can specify a CRS for the node coordinates.
  This does NOT convert node coordinates to a different CRS. It only assigns a CRS to the data or file.
  By default, the CRS is not specified (and is set to None).  
* The :class:`~wntr.gis.geospatial.snap` and :class:`~wntr.gis.geospatial.intersect` functions described 
  in the following sections require that datasets have the same CRS.
* Projected CRSs are preferred for more accurate distance calculations.

The following example reads a GeoJSON file and overrides the CRS to change it from EPSG:4326 to EPSG:3857.
(Note, this does not change the coordinates in the geometry column.)

Snap point geometries to the nearest point or line
----------------------------------------------------

The :class:`~wntr.gis.geospatial.snap` function is used to find the nearest point or line to a set of points. 
This functionality can be used to assign hydrants to junctions or assign isolation valves to pipes.

For example, when snapping point geometries in GeoDataFrame A to point or line geometries in GeoDataFrame B, 
the function returns the following information (one entry for each point in A):

* Nearest point or line in B
* Distance between original and snapped point
* Coordinates of the snapped point
* If B contains lines, the nearest endpoint along the nearest line
* If B contains lines, the relative distance from the line's start node (line position)

The network file, Net1.inp, in EPSG:4326 CRS is used in the example below. 
The additional GIS data in the GeoJSON format is also in EPSG:4326 CRS.
See :ref:`crs` for more information.

.. doctest::
    :skipif: gpd is None
	
    >>> wn = wntr.network.WaterNetworkModel('networks/Net1.inp') # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> wn_gis = wntr.network.to_gis(wn, crs='EPSG:4326')
	
Snap hydrants to junctions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

GIS data which include the network hydrant locations is useful in a resilience analysis. In particular, 
this information identifies which junctions could have their demands increased to simulate the opening 
of hydrants to fight fires or flush contaminated water out of the network, either of which could caused by a disaster scenario. 
The following example highlights the process to snap hydrants to junctions. The example dataset of hydrant 
locations is a GeoDataFrame with a `geometry` column that contains ``shapely.geometry.Point`` geometries and a 
`demand` column that defines fire flow requirements. 
The GeoPandas ``read_file`` method is used to read the GeoJSON file into a GeoDataFrame.  

.. doctest::
    :skipif: gpd is None
    
    >>> import geopandas as gpd
	
    >>> hydrant_data = gpd.read_file('data/Net1_hydrant_data.geojson') # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> print(hydrant_data)
       demand                   geometry
    0    5000  POINT (48.20000 37.20000)
    1    1500  POINT (71.80000 68.30000)
    2    8000  POINT (51.20000 71.10000)

The following example uses the function :class:`~wntr.gis.snap` to snap hydrant locations to the nearest junction 
within a tolerance of 5.0 units (the tolerance is in the units of the GIS coordinate system).
	
.. doctest::
    :skipif: gpd is None

    >>> snapped_to_junctions = wntr.gis.snap(hydrant_data, wn_gis.junctions, tolerance=5.0)
    >>> print(snapped_to_junctions)
      node  snap_distance                   geometry
    0   22          3.329  POINT (50.00000 40.00000)
    1   13          2.476  POINT (70.00000 70.00000)
    2   12          1.628  POINT (50.00000 70.00000)

The data, water network model, and snapped points can be plotted as follows. The resulting :numref:`fig-snap-points` illustrates 
the hydrants snapped to the junctions in Net1.

.. doctest::
    :skipif: gpd is None

    >>> ax = hydrant_data.plot()
    >>> ax = wntr.graphics.plot_network(wn,

Snap valves to pipes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

GIS data of the network isolation valve locations can be used to identify which pipes to 
close during a pipe break scenario. The following example highlights the process to snap valves to pipes.   
The example dataset of valve locations is a GeoDataFrame with a `geometry` column that contains ``shapely.geometry.Point`` geometries.

.. doctest::
    :skipif: gpd is None

    >>> valve_data = gpd.read_file('data/Net1_valve_data.geojson') # doctest: +SKIP

    1  POINT (32.10000 67.60000)
    2  POINT (52.70000 86.30000)
	
The following example uses the function :class:`~wntr.gis.snap` to snap valve locations to the nearest pipe 
within a tolerance of 5.0 degrees.

.. doctest::
    :skipif: gpd is None

Find the intersect between geometries
--------------------------------------

The :class:`~wntr.gis.geospatial.intersect`  function is used to find the intersection between geometries.
This functionality can be used to identify faults, landslides, or other hazards that intersect pipes,
or assign community resilience indicators (e.g., population characteristics, economic), future climate projections, hazards/risks, or other data to network components.

When finding the intersection of GeoDataFrame A with GeoDataFrame B (where A and B can contain points, lines, or polygons),
the function returns the following information (one entry for each geometry in A):

* List of intersecting B geometry indices
* Number of intersecting B geometries

The following additional information is returned when geometries in B are assigned a value:

* List of intersecting B geometry values
* Minimum B geometry value
* Maximum B geometry value
* Mean B geometry value
* If A contains lines and B contains polygons, weighted mean value (weighted by intersecting length)

When the B geometry contains polygons, the user can optionally include the background in the intersection.
This is useful when working with geometries that do not cover the entire region of interest.
For example, while census tracts cover the entire region, hazard maps might contain gaps (regions with no hazard) 
that the user might want to include in the intersection.

The network file, Net1.inp, in EPSG:4326 CRS is used in the example below. 
Additional GIS data in the GeoJSON format is also in EPSG:4326 CRS.
See :ref:`crs` for more information.

Assign earthquake probability to pipes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

GIS data that includes earthquake fault lines can be used in a resilience analysis to identify pipes which 
have the potential to be damaged during an earthquake. The following example highlights the process to assign earthquake
probabilities to pipes. The example dataset of earthquake fault lines is a GeoDataFrame with a `geometry` column 
that contains ``shapely.geometry.LineString`` geometries and a `Pr` column which contains probability of an earthquake over magnitude 7.

Assign landslide probability to pipes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Landslide hazard zones GIS data can be used to identify pipes with the potential to be affected during a landslide. 
The following example highlights the process to assign landslide probabilities to pipes. The landslide hazard zones example dataset 
is a GeoDataFrame with a `geometry` column that contains ``shapely.geometry.LineString`` geometries and a 
`Pr` column which contains the probability of damage from a landslide in that zone.

.. doctest::
    :skipif: gpd is None

    >>> landslide_data = gpd.read_file('data/Net1_landslide_data.geojson') # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> print(landslide_data)

    2  0.90  POLYGON ((58.05971 44.48507, 58.11776 44.67615...
	
The following example uses the function :class:`~wntr.gis.intersect` to assign landslide hazard zone probabilities to pipes. 
This is very similar to the earthquake example above, except that the landslide hazards are polygons. Additionally, since the 
hazard map does not include a "background" value that defines the probability of damage outside landslide zones, 
the background conditions are included in the intersection function (i.e, the background value is assumed to be zero).

The data, water network model, and census tracts can be plotted as follows. The 
resulting :numref:`fig-intersect-demographics` illustrates Net1 with the intersection of junctions and pipes with the census tracts (polygons). 
The junctions and pipes are colored with their mean income and weighted mean income, respectively. Note that the color scale for 
the census tracts (polygons) is different than the junction and pipe attributes.
