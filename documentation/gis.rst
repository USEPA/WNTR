.. _geospatial:

Geospatial capabilities
======================================

The junctions, tanks, reservoirs, pipes, pumps, and valves in a water network model can be converted to 
GeoPandas GeoDataFrames as described in :ref:`model_io`.
The GeoDataFrames can be used 
directly within WNTR, 
in Python with geospatial packages such as GeoPandas and Shapely, and saved to GeoJSON and Shapefiles for use
in geographic information system (GIS) platforms.
Open source GIS platforms include QGIS and GRASS GIS.

.. note:: 
   The GIS capabilities described below require the Python packages **geopandas** [JVFM21]_ 
   and **rtree** [rtree]_, both are optional dependencies of WNTR.
   Note that **shapely** is installed with geopandas.
	
The following capabilities use data stored in GeoPandas GeoDataFrames.  
Each GeoDataFrame contain a `geometry` column which contains 
geometric objects commonly used in geospatial analysis.

:numref:`table-geometry-type` includes water network model components and the 
geometry type that defines each component.  
Geometry types include 
``shapely.geometry.Point``, ``shapely.geometry.LineString``, and ``shapely.geometry.MultiLineString``.
A few components can be defined using multiple types:

* Pumps and valves can be stored as Points or LineStrings. While Pumps are defined as 
  lines within WNTR (and EPANET), converting the geometry to Points can be useful for geospatial analysis and visualization.
* Pipes that do not contain vertices are stored as a LineString while pipes that contain 
  vertices are stored as a MultiLineString.

.. _table-geometry-type:
.. table:: Geometry types for water network model components
   
   ==============================  ===============================

   ==============================  ===============================

External datasets that are defined using geospatial data objects can be utilized within 
WNTR to add attributes to the water network model and the analysis.  Example external datasets include:

* Point geometries that contain utility billing data, hydrant locations, isolation valve locations, or the location of emergency services.
  These geometries can be associated with points and lines in a water network model by snapping the point to the nearest component.
* LineString or MultiLineString geometries that contain street layout or earthquake fault lines.
  These geometries can be associated with points and lines in a water network model by finding the intersection.
* Polygon geometries that contain elevation, building footprints, zoning, land cover, hazard maps, census data, demographics, or social vulnerability.
  These geometries can be associated with points and lines in a water network model by finding the intersection.

.. _working_with_geodataframes:

Working with GeoDataFrames
--------------------------

A WaterNetworkModel can be converted to a collection of GeoDataFrames using the function
:class:`~wntr.model.network.io.to_gis`.
One GeoDataFrame is created for each type of model component (Junction, Tank, Reservoir, Pipe, Pump, Valve).
Component attributes (e.g., junction elevation) are stored in the GeoDataFrame along with the 
component's geometry.

.. note:: 
   When converting a water network model into GeoDataFrames, the user can specify the 
   coordinate reference system (CRS) for the node coordinates.
   By default, the CRS is not specified (and is set to None).  
   CRSs can be geographic (e.g., latitude/longitude where the units are in degrees) or 
   projected (e.g., Universal Transverse Mercator where units are in meters).
   Projected CRSs are preferred for more accurate distance calculations.  
   GeoPandas includes documentation on managing projections and includes the ``to_crs`` method to convert between CRSs 
   Additionally, WNTR includes methods to modify coordinates, see :ref:`modify_node_coords` for more information.
   
The following example creates GeoDataFrames from a water network model.  Note that Net1 is used in the following example.
The CRS EPSG:4326 assumes that the coordinates are in degrees latitude and degrees longitude (which is not realistic for this network).  

.. doctest::
    :skipif: gpd is None

    >>> import wntr # doctest: +SKIP
	
    >>> wn = wntr.network.WaterNetworkModel('networks/Net1.inp') # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> wn_gis = wn.to_gis(crs='EPSG:4326')
	
Individual GeoDataFrames are obtained as follows (Note that Net1 has no valves and the GeoDataFrame for valves is empty).

.. doctest::
    :skipif: gpd is None

    >>> wn_gis.junctions # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> wn_gis.tanks # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> wn_gis.reservoirs # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> wn_gis.pipes # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> wn_gis.pumps # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> wn_gis.valves # doctest: +SKIP
	
For example, the junctions GeoDataFrame contains the following information

.. doctest::
    :skipif: gpd is None

    >>> print(wn_gis.junctions.head()) # doctest: +SKIP
              type  elevation  ... base_demand                   geometry
    name                       ...                                       
    10    Junction    216.408  ...    0.000000  POINT (20.00000 70.00000)
    11    Junction    216.408  ...    0.009464  POINT (30.00000 70.00000)
    12    Junction    213.360  ...    0.009464  POINT (50.00000 70.00000)
    13    Junction    211.836  ...    0.006309  POINT (70.00000 70.00000)
    21    Junction    213.360  ...    0.009464  POINT (30.00000 40.00000)

Additional attributes can be added to the GeoDataFrames using the 
:class:`~wntr.gis.network.WaterNetworkGIS.add_node_attributes` and 
:class:`~wntr.gis.network.WaterNetworkGIS.add_link_attributes` methods.
Additional attributes, such as simulation results or resilience metric, can be used in further analysis and visualization.

The following example adds simulated pressure at hour 1 to nodes (which includes junctions, tanks, and reservoirs).

.. doctest::
    :skipif: gpd is None

    >>> sim = wntr.sim.EpanetSimulator(wn)
    >>> results = sim.run_sim()
    >>> wn_gis.add_node_attributes(results.node['pressure'].loc[3600,:], 'Pressure_1hr')
	
Attributes can also be added directly to individual GeoDataFrames, as shown below.

.. doctest::
    :skipif: gpd is None

    >>> wn_gis.junctions['new attribute'] = 10

The GeoDataFrames can be saved to GeoJSON files using the :class:`~wntr.gis.network.WaterNetworkGIS.write` method.

.. doctest::
    :skipif: gpd is None

    >>> wn_gis.write('Net1', driver='GeoJSON')
	
This creates the following GeoJSON files for junctions, tanks, reservoirs, pipes, pumps, and valves:

* Net1_junctions.geojson
* Net1_tanks.geojson
* Net1_reservoirs.geojson
* Net1_pipes.geojson
* Net1_pumps.geojson
* Note, Net1_valves.geojson not created since Net1 has no valves

The `write` method includes an optional argument that sets the GeoPandas driver.  
This allows the user to create Shapefiles in addition to GeoJSON files.
These files can be loaded into GIS platforms for further analysis and visualization.

A water network model can also be created from a group of GeoDataFrames using the function
:class:`~wntr.network.io.from_gis`.

The following example creates a water network model from the group of GeoDataFrames created above.

.. doctest::
    :skipif: gpd is None

    >>> wn2 = wntr.network.from_gis(wn_gis)

Snap point geometries to the nearest point or line
----------------------------------------------------

The :class:`~wntr.gis.snap` function is used to find the nearest point or line to a set of points. 
This functionality can be used to assign hydrants to junctions or assign isolation valves to pipes.

When snapping Point geometries in GeoDataFrame A to Point or Line geometries in GeoDataFrame B, 
the function returns the following information (one entry for each point in A):

* Nearest point or line in B
* Distance between original and snapped point
* Coordinates of the snapped point
* If B contains Lines, the nearest endpoint along the nearest line
* If B contains Lines, the relative distance from the line's start node (line position)

The following examples used geospatial data stored in the `examples/data <https://github.com/USEPA/WNTR/blob/main/examples/data>`_ directory.
The GeoPandas ``read_file`` method is used to read the GeoJSON files into GeoDataFrames.  

Snap hydrants to junctions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The dataset used in this example defines hydrant locations.  
The dataset is a GeoDataFrame with a `geometry` column that contains ``shapely.geometry.Point`` geometries and a 
`demand` column that defines fire flow requirements.

.. doctest::
    :skipif: gpd is None
    
    >>> import geopandas as gpd # doctest: +SKIP
	
    >>> hydrant_data = gpd.read_file('data/Net1_hydrant_data.geojson') # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> print(hydrant_data)
       demand                   geometry
    0    5000  POINT (48.20000 37.20000)
    1    1500  POINT (71.80000 68.30000)
    2    8000  POINT (51.20000 71.10000)

The following example uses the function :class:`~wntr.gis.snap` to snap hydrant locations to the nearest junction.
	
.. doctest::
    :skipif: gpd is None

    >>> snapped_to_junctions = wntr.gis.snap(hydrant_data, wn_gis.junctions, tolerance=5.0)
    >>> print(snapped_to_junctions)

    2   12          1.628  POINT (50.00000 70.00000)

The data, water network model, and snapped points can be plotted as follows.

.. doctest::
    :skipif: gpd is None

    >>> ax = hydrant_data.plot()
    >>> ax = wntr.graphics.plot_network(wn, node_attribute=snapped_to_junctions['node'].to_list(), ax=ax)

.. doctest::
    :skipif: gpd is None
    :hide:

** By reversing the order of GeoDataFrames in the snap function**,
the nearest hydrant to each junction can also be identified.
Note that the tolerance is increased to ensure all junctions are assigned a hydrant.

Snap valves to pipes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The dataset used in this example defines valve locations.  
The dataset is a GeoDataFrame with a `geometry` column that contains ``shapely.geometry.Point`` geometries.

.. doctest::
    :skipif: gpd is None

    >>> valve_data = gpd.read_file('data/Net1_valve_data.geojson') # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> print(valve_data)

    1  POINT (32.10000 67.60000)
    2  POINT (52.70000 86.30000)
	
The following example uses the function :class:`~wntr.gis.snap` to snap valve locations to the nearest pipe.

.. doctest::
    :skipif: gpd is None

    >>> snapped_to_pipes = wntr.gis.snap(valve_data, wn_gis.pipes, tolerance=5.0)
    >>> print(snapped_to_pipes)
      link node  snap_distance  line_position                   geometry
    0   22   22            1.5          0.325  POINT (56.50000 40.00000)

The snapped locations can be used to define a :ref:`valvelayer` and then create network segments.

.. doctest::
    :skipif: gpd is None

    >>> valve_layer = snapped_to_pipes[['link', 'node']]
    >>> G = wn.get_graph()
    >>> node_segments, link_segments, segment_size = wntr.metrics.valve_segments(G, valve_layer)

The data, water network model, and valve layer can be plotted as follows.

.. doctest::
    :skipif: gpd is None

    >>> ax = valve_data.plot()
    >>> ax = wntr.graphics.plot_valve_layer(wn, valve_layer, add_colorbar=False, ax=ax)

   Example valve layer created by snapping points to lines

Find the intersect between geometries
--------------------------------------

The :class:`~wntr.gis.intersect`  function is used to find the intersection between geometries.
This functionality can be used to identify faults or landslides that intersect pipes,
or assign demographic data to network components.

When finding the intersection of GeoDataFrame A with GeoDataFrame B (where A and B can contain Points, Lines, or Polygons),
the function returns the following information (one entry for each geometry in A):

* List of intersecting B geometry indices
* Number of intersecting B geometries

The following additional information is returned when geometries in B are assigned a value:

* List of intersecting B geometry values
* Minimum B geometry value
* Maximum B geometry value
* Mean B geometry value
* If A contains Lines and B contains Polygons, weighted mean value (weighted by intersecting length)

When the B geometry contains Polygons, the user can optionally include the background in the intersection.
This is useful when working with geometries that do not cover the entire region of interest.
For example, while census tracts cover the entire region, hazard maps might contain gaps (regions with no hazard) 
that the user might want to include in the intersection.

Assign earthquake probability to pipes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The dataset used in this example contains earthquake fault lines.
The dataset is a GeoDataFrame with a `geometry` column that contains ``shapely.geometry.LineString`` geometries and a 
`Pr` column which contains probability of an earthquake over magnitude 7.

.. doctest::
    :skipif: gpd is None

    >>> earthquake_data = gpd.read_file('data/Net1_earthquake_data.geojson') # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> print(earthquake_data)

The data and water network model can be plotted as follows.  
Pipes are colored with their max probability.

The intersect function can also be used to identify pipes that cross each fault simply by reversing 
the order in which the geometries intersect, as shown below:

.. doctest::
    :skipif: gpd is None

    >>> pipes_that_intersect_each_fault = wntr.gis.intersect(earthquake_data, wn_gis.pipes)
    >>> print(pipes_that_intersect_each_fault)

    3       [21, 31, 112, 12]  4

Assign landslide probability to pipes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The dataset used in this example contains landslide hazard zones.
The dataset is a GeoDataFrame with a `geometry` column that contains ``shapely.geometry.LineString`` geometries and a 
`Pr` column which contains probability of damage from a landslide in that zone.

.. doctest::
    :skipif: gpd is None

    >>> landslide_data = gpd.read_file('data/Net1_landslide_data.geojson') # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> print(landslide_data)
         Pr                                           geometry
    0  0.50  POLYGON ((28.84615 22.23077, 28.76040 22.05079...
    1  0.75  POLYGON ((40.00708 1.83192, 33.00708 84.83192,...
    2  0.90  POLYGON ((58.05971 44.48507, 58.11776 44.67615...
	
The following example uses the function :class:`~wntr.gis.intersect` to assign earthquake hazard map with pipes. 
This is very similar to the earthquake example above, except that the landslide hazards are polygons.  Additionally, since the
