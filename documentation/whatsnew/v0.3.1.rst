v0.3.1 (master branch)
---------------------------------------------------

* The `run_sim` method for the EpanetSimulator now includes the option to define convergence error behavior.
  
  * If the simulation does not converge and `convergence_error` is True, an error is raised. 
  * If the simulation does not converge and `convergence_error` is False, partial results are returned, a warning is issued, and results object `error_code` is set to 0.
  
  The default setting for `convergence_error` when using the EpanetSimulator is False.
  
* The default setting for `convergence_error` in the WNTRSimulator was changed to False.
  
* Updated the `add_outage` method on pumps so it can be used with the EpanetSimulator.  
  Added a `remove_outage` method on pumps.
 
* Added a `convert_controls_to_rules` method on the water network model.  In some instances, mixing controls and rules has unexpected consequences.  
  By converting all controls to rules, the user can specify the priority for each rule. 
  
* Added a function to compute valve segment attributes from a valve layer (`valve_segment_attributes`).  This includes 
  the number of valves surrounding each valve,
  the increase in segment demand if a given valve is removed, and 
  the increase in segment pipe length if a given valve is removed. 
  
* Added graphics options to plot valve layers and valve segment attributes (`plot_valve_layer`).
  Removed options in `plot_network` that plot valve layers.  
  
* Added a function to generate a randomly ordered colormap (`random_colormap`).  Updated `custom_colormap` so that the number of bins is not an optional argument.

* Changed `plot_network` to return a matplotlib axes object rather than networkx nodes and edges objects. 
  This helps use the axes to layer additional data (such as valve segment attributes).

* Suppressed the OptimizeWarning from scipy.optimize that often occurs when fitting a pump curve.  
  This is not an error.

* Bug fix in the pump energy calculation and added additional tests.  The function, which was returning power in Watts, now returns energy in Joules. 

* Pump cost function was updated to use pump energy, instead of recomputing those values.

* Updated API documentation to include a table of class properties for each network class (Junction, Tank, Pipe, etc.).
