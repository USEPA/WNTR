v0.1.5 (May 29, 2018)
---------------------------------------------------

* Replaced the use of Pandas Panels with a dictionary of Pandas DataFrames (Pandas is deprecating Panels).
  This changes the way users interact with simulation results.
  
  * Removed 'expected_demand' and 'type' from simulation results.  Expected demand can be computed using :class:`~wntr.metrics.hydraulic.expected_demand`.
    Node and link type is stored in the WaterNetworkModel and is no longer used to compute metrics.
	
  * Removed simulation_results example, example code is now embedded in the documentation.
  
* Updated metrics to use simulation results in the new format and to clarify names.  

  * Input arguments are now more explicit, e.g. pass a DataFrame with junction demands instead of an entire Panel with information that might not be used.
  
  * Updated the following metric names: changed fdv (fraction of delivered volume) to water_service_availability,
    todini to todini_index, cost to annual_network_cost, ghg_emissions to annual_ghg_emissions.
  
  * Removed the following metrics: fdd (fraction of delivered demand) and fdq (fraction of delivered quality), 
    these can be computed with simple queries on demand and quality simulation results.

* Improved error messages when simulation does not converge.
* Updated default options for the WNTRSimulator.
* Bug fix in node registries for the use of patterns.
* Changed default colormap in network graphics from jet to Spectral_r.
* Updated documentation.
