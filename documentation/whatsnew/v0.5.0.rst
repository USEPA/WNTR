.. _whatsnew_050:

v0.5.0 (main)
---------------------------------------------------
* Added GIS capabilities in a `wntr.gis` module, which includes the following:

  * Convert between water network models and GIS formatted data (GeoPandas) 
    and GIS formatted files (GeoJSON and Shapefiles)
  
  * Snap GeoPandas point data to elements in a water network model
  
  * Find the intersection between GeoPandas points, line or polygons and 
    elements in a water network model
  
  * See :ref:`geospatial` section of the user manual for more information.

* Removed the `read_inpfile`, `write_inpfile`, `read_json`, and `write_json` methods from the WaterNetworkModel.  
  This functionality is still available using `wntr.network.read_inpfile`, `wntr.network.write_inpfile`, 
  `wntr.network.read_json` and `wntr.network.write_json`
  and is located with other read/write functions.

* Added support for Python 3.10, dropped support for Python 3.6.
  The build workflow now creates wheel artifacts.  
  `#287 <https://github.com/USEPA/WNTR/pull/287>`_, 
  `#294 <https://github.com/USEPA/WNTR/pull/294>`_

* The `_evaluator` and `_network_isolation` binaries are no longer 
  distributed with the code.  The setup.py file now includes an optional argument to build the binaries.
  Developer installation instructions have been updated.
  
* Updated documentation `#291 <https://github.com/USEPA/WNTR/pull/291>`_, 
  `#292 <https://github.com/USEPA/WNTR/pull/292>`_
