v0.1.6 (September 11, 2018)
---------------------------------------------------

* Introduced a known discrepancy between the WNTRSimulator and EpanetSimulator 
  to model pump speed controls. See :ref:`discrepancies`.

  * Pumps have speed settings which are adjustable by controls and/or patterns.  
    With the EpanetSimulator, controls and patterns adjust the actual speed.  
    With the WNTRSimulator, pumps have a 'base speed' (similar to junction demand 
    and reservoir head), controls adjust the base speed, and speed patterns are 
    a are a multiplier on the base speed. Results from the two simulators 
    can match by scaling speed patterns and using controls appropriately.

* Fixed bugs in the EPANET INP file reader/writer that impacted some model files, including 
  issues with time controls, pump price and pattern, general purpose valves, and 
  the demand section.

* Included constant power pumps in annual network cost metric.

* Updated the way hydraulic and reporting timesteps are handled.  If the 
  reporting timestep is greater than the hydraulic timestep, then it is reset and a 
  warning message is raised.

* Restricted software tests to use Plotly version 2.x.  Plotly version 3 is not yet
  compatible with network graphics.
  
* Updated documentation.
