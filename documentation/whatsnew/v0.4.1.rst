.. _whatsnew_041:

v0.4.1 (main)
---------------------------------------------------

* Added a function to compute the modified resilience index, ``wntr.metrics.modified_resilience_index``.  The modified resilience 
  index is a measure of total surplus power. The metric can be computed as a timeseries for each junction or as a system average timeseries.

* Added a function to compute tank capacity, ``wntr.metrics.tank_capacity``.  Tank capacity is the ratio of water volume to the maximum 
  water volume for each tank and is reported as a timeseries.

* Updated the WNTRSimulator to use ``wn.options.time.pattern_start``.

* Added the ability to set the random seed when sampling damage states from fragility curves.

* Added methods to update parameters used to define rules and controls.

* Updated ``wntr.morph.split_pipe`` and ``wntr.morph.break_pipe`` to include pipe vertices.

* Removed private attribute on pumps associated with power outage controls which is no longer needed.

* Added functionality to convert the water network model to a dictionary or JSON formatted file and 
  create a water network model from a dictionary or JSON formatted file. 
  The new functionality is located in ``wntr.network.io`` and includes ``to_dict``, ``from_dict``, 
  ``write_json`` and ``read_json``.  These can also be called using methods on the WaterNetworkModel object.

* Added the Jupyter Notebook demos into the testing framework.
