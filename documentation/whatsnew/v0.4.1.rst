v0.4.1 (main)
---------------------------------------------------

* Added a function to compute the modified resilience index, ``wntr.metrics.modified_resilience_index`.  The modified resilience 
  index is a measure of total surplus power. The metric can be computed as a timeseries for each junction or as a system average timeseries.

* Added a function to compute tank capacity, ``wntr.metrics.tank_capacity``.  Tank capacity is the ratio of water volume to the maximum 
  water volume for each tank and is reported as a timeseries.

* Updated the WNTRSimulator to use ``wn.options.time.pattern_start``.

* Removed private attribute on pumps associated with power outage controls which is no longer needed.
