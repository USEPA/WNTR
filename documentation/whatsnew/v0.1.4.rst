v0.1.4 (Master branch)
---------------------------------------------------

* Added a faster EPANET binary output file reader
* Added ability to get the names of all required objects that are queried or acted upon by the control (see :class:`~wntr.network.controls.Control.requires`)
* Modified the structure of the WaterNetworkOptions object to group options into types (API change, see :class:`~wntr.network.options.WaterNetworkOptions`)
* Created a Pattern object that can be called to get the pattern value at a specific time (see :class:`~wntr.network.elements.Pattern`)
* Created a TimeSeries object that contains a base value, Pattern object, and category.  The object can be called to get its value at a specific time.
  TimeSeries are used to store junction demand, source injection, pricing, pump speed, and reservoir head. (see :class:`~wntr.network.elements.TimeSeries`)
* Created a Demands object that contains multiple demands for a single junction and can 
  calculate demand values at a specific time.  Change to the way multiple demands are stored makes the 
  Junction.base_demand and Junction.demand_pattern_name *read-only* attributes (API change).
* Added support for flow control valves (FCV), multiple demands at a junction, and variable reservoir head in the WNTRSimulator
* Modified the WaterNetworkModel.add_pattern() to no longer accept start_time and end_time options.  
  Binary patterns can be created using the Patterns object (API change, see :class:`~wntr.network.elements.Pattern.binary_pattern`).
