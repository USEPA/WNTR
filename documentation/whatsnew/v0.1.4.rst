v0.1.4 (February 23, 2018)
---------------------------------------------------

v0.1.4 includes several changes that improve simulation stability and tests to ensure that simulations run using WNTR match EPANET simulations.
In addition to the publicly available software tests on https://travis-ci.org/sandialabs/WNTR, 
WNTR is also tested on private servers using several large water utility network models. 

* Added a faster EPANET binary output file reader
* Updated the order in which controls operate to match EPANET
* Updated controls classes to include Control and Rule objects (API change, see :class:`~wntr.network.controls.Control` and :class:`~wntr.network.controls.Rule`)
* Added ability to get the names of all required objects that are queried or acted upon by the control/rule (see :class:`~wntr.network.controls.Control.requires`)
* Modified the structure of the Options object to group options into types (API change, see :class:`~wntr.network.options.Options`)
* Created water network model objects for different types of valves (see 
  :class:`~wntr.network.elements.PRValve`, 
  :class:`~wntr.network.elements.PSValve`, 
  :class:`~wntr.network.elements.PBValve`, 
  :class:`~wntr.network.elements.FCValve`, 
  :class:`~wntr.network.elements.TCValve`, and
  :class:`~wntr.network.elements.GPValve`) and pumps (see
  :class:`~wntr.network.elements.HeadPump` and 
  :class:`~wntr.network.elements.PowerPump`)
* Created a Pattern object that contains a list of values (see :class:`~wntr.network.elements.Pattern`)

  * A Pattern object can be called to get the pattern value at a specific time
  
* Created a TimeSeries object that contains a base value, Pattern object, and category (see :class:`~wntr.network.elements.TimeSeries`)

  * TimeSeries are used to store junction demand, source injection, pricing, pump speed, and reservoir head
  * A TimeSeries object can be called to get the timeseries value at a specific time 

* Created a Demands object to store a list of TimeSeries objects (see :class:`~wntr.network.elements.Demands`)

  * Demands are used to store multiple demands at a single junction
  * A Demands object can be called to get the total demand at a specific time (does not include the demand multiplier)
  * Since a junction can have multiple demands, 'base_demand' is no longer a Junction attribute (API change). The Demands object can be used to extract the base value per demand.  
  * Expected demand and average daily expected demand can be calculated using new metrics (see :class:`~wntr.metrics.hydraulic.expected_demand` and :class:`~wntr.metrics.hydraulic.average_expected_demand`).
    The metric 'average_water_consumed' has been removed.

* Added support for flow control valves (FCV), multiple demands at a junction, variable reservoir head, and rule timesteps in the WNTRSimulator
* Modified the dependence between the WaterNetworkModel and the NetworkX graph.  The graph is now built from scratch when WaterNetworkModel.get_graph() is called.  
  WaterNetworkModel.get_graph_deep_copy() has been removed (API change, see :class:`~wntr.network.model.WaterNetworkModel.get_graph`).
* Modified the WaterNetworkModel.add_pattern() to no longer accept start_time and end_time options.  
  Binary patterns can be created using the Patterns object (API change, see :class:`~wntr.network.elements.Pattern.binary_pattern`).
* Added ENsaveinpfile to the EPANET toolkit (see :class:`~wntr.epanet.toolkit.ENepanet.ENsaveinpfile`)
* Updated documentation
