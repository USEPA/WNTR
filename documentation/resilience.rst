Resilience metrics
======================================

Resilience of water distribution networks refers to the 
design, maintenance, and operations of that network.  
All these aspects must work together to limit the effects of disasters and 
enables rapid return to normal delivery of safe water to customers.
Numerous resilience metrics have been suggested [USEPA14]_.  
These metrics generally fall into five categories: topographic, hydraulic, water quality, water security, and economic.
When quantifying resilience, 
it is important to understand which metric best defines resilience for 
a particular scenario.  WNTR includes many metrics to help 
users compare resilience using different methods.

The following sections outline metrics that can be computed using WNTR, including: 

* Topographic metrics (:numref:`table-topographic-metrics`)

* Hydraulic metrics (:numref:`table-hydraulic-metrics`)

* Water quality metrics (:numref:`table-water-quality-metrics`)

* Water security metrics (:numref:`table-water-security-metrics`)

* Economic metrics (:numref:`table-economic-metrics`)

While some metrics define resilience as a single network-wide quantity, other metrics define 
quantities that are a function of time, space, or both. 
For this reason, state transition plots [BaRR13]_  and network graphics
are useful ways to visualize resilience and compare metrics, as shown in :numref:`fig-metrics`.
In the state transition plot, the x-axis represents time (before, during, and after a disruptive incident).  
The y-axis represents performance.  This can be any time varying resilience metric that responds to the disruptive state.  
State transition plots are often generated to show time varying performance of the system, but they can also represent the time varying performance of individual components, like tanks or pipes.
Network graphics are useful to visualize resilience metrics that vary with respect to location.
For metrics that vary with respect to time and space, network animation can be used to illustrate resilience.

The example **resilience_metrics.py** demonstrates how to compute these metrics.

Topographic metrics
---------------------

Topographic metrics, based on graph theory, can be used to assess the connectivity 
of water distribution networks.
These metrics rely on the physical layout of the network components and can be used to
understand how the underlying structure and connectivity constrains resilience. For
example, a regular lattice, where each node has the same number of edges, is considered to be
the most reliable graph structure. On the other hand, a random lattice has nodes and edges
that are placed according to a random process. A real world water distribution system probably lies somewhere in
between a regular lattice and a random lattice in terms of structure and reliability.
  
NetworkX includes a wide range of topographic metrics that can be computed using 
the WntrMutliDiGraph.  WNTR includes additional methods/metrics to help compute 
resilience. These methods are in the :meth:`~wntr.network.graph.WntrMultiDiGraph` class.
Commonly used topographic metrics are listed in :numref:`table-topographic-metrics`.  
Information on additional topographic metrics supported by NetworkX can be found 
at https://networkx.github.io/.

   Metric                                 Description
   =====================================  ================================================================================================================================================
   Node degree                            Node degree is the number of links adjacent to a node.  Node degree is a 
                                          measure of the number of branches in a network.  A node with degree 0 is not 
                                          connected to the network.  Terminal nodes have degree 1. A node connected to every node (including itself) 
                                          has a degree equal to the number of nodes in the network.  
                                          The average node degree is a system wide metric used to describe the number of 
                                          connected links in a network.
                                          Node degree can be computed using the NetworkX method ``degree``.
                                          Terminal nodes can be found using the method :meth:`~wntr.network.graph.WntrMultiDiGraph.terminal_nodes`.

   Link density                           Link density is the ratio between the total number of links and the maximum 
                                          number of links in the network.  If links are allowed to connect a node to 
                                          itself, then the maximum number of links is :math:`{n}^{2}`, where :math:`n` is the number of nodes.  
                                          Otherwise, the maximum number of nodes is :math:`n(n-1)`.  Link density is 0 for a graph without edges 
                                          and 1 for a dense graph. The density of multigraphs can be higher than 1.
                                          Link density can be computed using the NetworkX method ``density``.

   Eccentricity and diameter              Eccentricity is the maximum number of links between a node and all other nodes 
                                          in the graph. Eccentricity is a value between 0 and the number of links 
                                          in the network.  
                                          Diameter is the maximum eccentricity in the network. 
                                          Eccentricity and diameter can only be computed using undirected, connected networks.
                                          Network X includes a method to convert directed graphs to undirected graphs, ``to_undirected``, and 
                                          to check if graphs are connected, ``is_connected``.
                                          Eccentricity and diameter can be computed using the  NetworkX methods 
                                          ``eccentricity`` and ``diameter``.

   Simple paths                           A simple path is a path between two nodes that does not repeat any nodes.  NetworkX includes a method, ``all_simple_paths``, to compute
                                          all simple paths between two nodes.  
                                          The method :meth:`~wntr.network.graph.WntrMultiDiGraph.links_in_simple_paths`
                                          can be used to extract all links in a simple path along with the number of times each link was used in the paths. 
                                          Paths can be time dependent, if related to simulated flow direction.  The method :meth:`~wntr.network.graph.WntrMultiDiGraph.weight_graph` can be used 
                                          to weight the graph by a specified attribute.

   Shortest path lengths                  Shortest path lengths is the minimum number of links between a source node and all 
                                          other nodes in the network.  Shortest path length is a value between 0 and 
                                          the number of links in the network.
                                          The average shortest path length is a system wide metric used to describe the number
                                          of links between a node and all other nodes.
                                          Shortest path lengths and average shortest path lengths can be computed using the following NetworkX methods
                                          ``shortest_path_length`` and ``average_shortest_path_length``.

   Betweenness centrality                 Betweenness centrality is the fraction of shortest paths that pass through each 
                                          node.  Betweenness coefficient is a value between 0 and 1.
                                          Central point dominance is the average difference in betweenness centrality 
                                          of the most central point (having the maximum betweenness centrality) 
                                          and all other nodes. These metrics can be computed using the NetworkX methods ``betweenness_centrality`` and the method :meth:`~wntr.network.graph.WntrMultiDiGraph.central_point_dominance`

   Closeness centrality                   Closeness centrality is the inverse of the sum of shortest path from one node to all other nodes.
                                          Closeness centrality can be computed using the NetworkX method ``closeness_centrality``.

   Articulation points                    A node is considered an articulation point if the removal of that node 
                                          (along with all its incident edges) increases the number of connected 
                                          components of a network.
                                          Density of articulation points is the ratio of the number of articulation 
                                          points and the total number of nodes.  
                                          Density of articulation points is a value between 0 and 1.
                                          Articulation points can be computed using the NetworkX method ``articulation_points``.

   Bridges                                A link is considered a bridge if the removal of that link increases the number of connected components in the network.
                                          The ratio of the number of bridges and the total number of links in the network is the bridge density.  Bridge density is a value between 0 and 1.
                                          The method :meth:`~wntr.network.graph.WntrMultiDiGraph.bridges` can be used to find bridges in a network.

Hydraulic metrics
---------------------

Hydraulic metrics are based upon variable flows and/or pressure. The 
calculation of these metrics requires simulation of network hydraulics that reflect how the
system operates under normal or abnormal conditions.  
Hydraulic metrics included in WNTR are listed in  :numref:`table-hydraulic-metrics`.  

.. _table-hydraulic-metrics:

   =====================================  ================================================================================================================================================
   Pressure                               To determine the number of node-time pairs above or below a specified pressure threshold, 
                                          use the :meth:`~wntr.metrics.misc.query` method on results.node['pressure'].  

   Todini index                           The Todini index [Todi00]_ is related to the capability of a system to overcome 
                                          failures while still meeting demands and pressures at the nodes. The 
                                          Todini index defines resilience at a specific time as a measure of surplus 
                                          power at each node and measures relative energy redundancy. 
                                          The Todini index can be computed using the :meth:`~wntr.metrics.hydraulic.todini` method.

   Entropy                                Entropy [AwGB90]_ is a measure of uncertainty in a random variable.  
                                          In a water distribution network model, the random variable is 
                                          flow in the pipes and entropy can be used to measure alternate flow paths
                                          when a network component fails.  A network that carries maximum entropy 
                                          flow is considered reliable with multiple alternate paths.
                                          Connectivity will change at each time step, depending on the flow direction.  
                                          The method :meth:`~wntr.network.graph.WntrMultiDiGraph.weight_graph` method can be used to weight the graph by a specified attribute.

   Population impacted                    Population that is impacted by a specific quantity can be computed using the 
                                          :meth:`~wntr.metrics.misc.population_impacted` method.  For example, this method can be used to compute the population
                                          impacted by pressure below a specified threshold.
